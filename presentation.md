## Why Rice your computer

Why not? I like to be as productive as possible and to do that I like to
customize every little aspect of the way my computer works.


## How to Rice

At it's heart it's a simple process, you install a program, look at what
configuration options it allows for and you customize that program.

Repeat until you get that perfect _rice_.


# Examples

## Window managers

There are 2 main kinds of window managers:

<div class="fragment">
- Floating window managers, which are what you're used to on Windows or MacOS.
</div>
<div class="fragment">
- Titling window managers, which are based on the concept that you screen should
    always be as full as possible.
</div>

<div class="fragment">
This works by making the first window you open full screen and the subsequent
windows split the space of the current window in half.
</div>

# Community

## Community

As with any other hobby, there is a community around it and this is community is
**based** on sharing knowledge. Much like the open source movement.




E interessante ter de configurar coisas que as pessoas tem por garantido


Ricing a linux desktop
- Configurar coisas que normalmente sao dadas como garantidas
- fazer o meu proprio music player sem querer
- Don't like it change it


- open source
- sharing and learning from others
- tiling vs floating
- automatizacao
- perda de tempo que vale a pena
